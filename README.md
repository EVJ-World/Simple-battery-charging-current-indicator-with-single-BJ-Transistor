# Simple-battery-charging-current-indicator-with-single-BJ-Transistor
This circuit detects DC current by measuring realitivy low (about 200mV) dropout voltage on shunt resistor R1. This is achieved by adding a 400mV difference to the transistor base. A additional 0.4V voltage is created with a divider from R2+R3 resistors.
